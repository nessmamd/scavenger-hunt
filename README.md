As part of a course project, I developed a single-stage virtual reality (VR) game using Unity and C#, focused on exploring the relationship between sensory immersion and user performance. The game incorporated rigid body physics to simulate realistic object interactions within the environment, and it was designed to be experienced through NVIDIA augmented reality (AR) glasses in combination with a haptic feedback device. These technologies allowed us to deliver both visual and tactile stimuli, creating a rich, immersive environment.

The core objective of the project was to investigate whether adding haptic feedback and AR visual layers could improve memory retention and in-game performance compared to experiences without sensory augmentation. Our findings supported the hypothesis that multi-sensory input enhances user engagement, interaction accuracy, and post-experience recall.

This project not only deepened my understanding of VR development workflows and physics-based interaction design in Unity, but also strengthened my skills in C# scripting, hardware integration, and user-centered game design. It served as a valuable hands-on opportunity to blend software engineering with cognitive research and interactive media.
